                      <strong>Lt. Colonel Mahendra Singh Dhoni</strong>, commonly known as MS Dhoni, is a former Indian international cricketer who captained 
                      the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2016. 
                      Dhoni is considered one of the best wicket-keeper batsmen in the history of cricket.
                       He led India to numerous victories, including the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cups, 
                       and the 2011 ICC Cricket World Cup.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                      Dhoni is known for his exceptional skills behind the stumps and his ability to finish matches with his aggressive batting style.
                       He holds several records, including the most international matches as captain and the most stumpings in international cricket.
                    Dhoni achieved all the laurels while keeping his stoic presence on and off the field, thus earning the title
                     <strong>"Captain Cool"</strong>.

            <p class="Foundationsp">
                Hailing from Jharkhand, Mahendra Singh Dhoniâ€™s rise through the ranks into international cricket is a tale of rebellion, 
                extraordinary merit, perseverance, and, most of all, belief. After being scouted on the whims of his school P.E. teacher 
                as a wicketkeeper, Dhoni created whispers in the cricketing circles of Ranchi - a teenage boy with no measurable upper-body 
                strength clearing boundaries against some of the best fast bowlers of the district. 
                
                <br>
                However, the system failed him as
                 he found it difficult to make the cut against candidates of the more affluent A-tier states. Consequently, 
                 in a desperate move, he joined the Railways Ranji team and started to work as a ticket collector at the Kharagpur 
                 railway station to make ends meet.

Nevertheless, in a few months, the stars started to align themselves for the precocious wunderkind from Ranchi.
 Inspired by the KSCA, the BCCI started a country-wide Training Research Development Wing to scout talent from the 
 more financially backward states. Dhoni immediately caught the eyes of the scouts and was sent on an A tour to Kenya,
  where his talent burst forth for the world to see as he showcased his batting pyrotechnics against world-class bowlers
   in alien conditions. He immediately shot to national reckoning and was selected for the tour of Bangladesh in November 2004.
            

            <br>
            <br>

            In a state where leather ball cricket was a luxury, Dhoni grew up playing tennis ball cricket tournaments. 
                With heavy Kashmir willow bats, light and hollow tennis balls, and long boundaries, he developed a bottomhand-dominated technique 
                to impart maximum power on the light tennis ball which undergoes energy-damping upon impact. However, Dhoni stood out when he, 
                along with a friend, developed an elevated body-weight shot with an exaggerated follow-through that cleared boundaries with ease.
                 On that count, 
                cricketing folklore will remember MS Dhoni as the man who had the audacity to play the 
                <strong>'helicopter shot'</strong> against the leather ball.</p>
